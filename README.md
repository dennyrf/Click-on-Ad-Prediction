# Click-on-Ad-Prediction
This program aims to predict whether visitors will click on advertisements or not using several features available in the dataset. The features used are time spent on site, area income, and daily internet usage, using the Logistic Regression method. The results are then evaluated.

Both the script and the dataset that can be accessed have been provided in this repository.

Thank you to GABRIEL SANTELLO for creating the dataset that can be used for this program.
